# SmartHome-AR

A concept of controlling smart home appliances though AR interface üòâ.

It's a college final year project implemented on Android (Back in 2017), but can also supports iOS.

## How it works?

The switch controls will be shown virtually when you point your mobile camera to a smart appliance.

Hover/Gesture your hand over the switch (in an AR way) will toggle the state of the smart appliance.

- You can see the `conference paper` for more understanding.

- Also attached the `slides` used for demo presentation.

**On action:**

## Applications
- Smart glasses (Ironman style üòé)
- Possibilities are countless...

## Setup environment and tools

1. Android SDK
2. Unity
3. Vuforia engine
4. QR code or some image (for AR interfacing)
5. Firebase project
6. AndroidThings board for IOT (or RaspberryPi)
7. An Android device with camera ofcourse üòÅ

### Setup Vuforia

- Create an account in Vuforia portal
- Upload the AR interfacing image or QR code for masking
- Build and import onto the project

### Setup AndroidThings

- Download and Flash latest Android Image
- Create an Android app project
- Design a cool interface indicating 2 LEDs. (I didn't use real LEDs for demo but Android Things has GPIO controls)
- Add Firebase library dependencies
- Connect to Firebase realtime database (Setup instructions are below üëáüèª)
- Listen to the realtime database for changes (Database configured below üëáüèª)
- Update UI accordingly
- Upload the app to AndroidThings

### Setup Firebase project

- Create a new Firebase project - (**SmartHome App**)
- Import the `google-services.json` file onto Unity app and AndroidThings app.
- Init Realtime database, like

```json
{
  "controls": {
    "led1": true,
    "led2": false
  }
}
```

The `controls` is the root of the database. The control values `led1` and `led2` indicate the ON/OFF state of the LEDs.

### Setup Unity app

- Setup Firebase Unity project (See [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup))
- Setup Firebase Realtime database (See [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/unity/start))

Note: Project contains **outdated** library and implementation of Realtime database. Recommend to upgrade them.
